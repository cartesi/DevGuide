# Cartesi Developer's Guide: Build dApps from scratch with ease

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cartesi dApp Developer Guide! This comprehensive guide will assist you building and deploying dApps on Cartesi.

Currently, two(2) methods exist for creating dApps on Cartesi:

- The first is a [simplified approach](/simplified%20approach/)that uses [Sunodo](docs.sunodo.io), an easy-to-use CLI tool that allows for rapid bootstrapping and building. 

- The second method is the [primitive approach](/primitive%20approach/), which is a more verbose dApp creation process.

This guide provides a detailed yet accessible explanation of how to use these two(2) distinct methods.


## Getting Started

Each approach has 3 versions that caters to macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. 

### Prerequisites

- Docker with Docker Buildkit enabled is needed for building and running the environment. (Docker Desktop is recommended as it enables Buildkit by default, and also QEMU-RISC V support)

- VS Code is highly recommended as the IDE of choice
